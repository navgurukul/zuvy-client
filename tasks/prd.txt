## 4. General Layout and Component Styling Notes
*   **Responsiveness:** The dashboard must be fully responsive and adapt to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Spacing:**
    *   Default margin between distinct dashboard sections (Course Banner, Upcoming, Curriculum, Attendance): `1.5rem` (`space-y-6` or `mb-6`).
    *   Internal padding for `Card` components: `1.5rem` (`p-6`).
    *   Spacing for grouped items (e.g., within the "Upcoming" section lists): `0.5rem` to `1rem` (`gap-2`, `gap-4`).
*   **Interactivity:**
    *   Buttons and interactive elements should follow the `3.5rem` height (`h-14`) and `1rem` horizontal padding (`px-4`) guidelines where applicable.
    *   Use subtle hover and focus states as defined by `shadcn/ui` and customized by "Academia Futura" (e.g., `--ring` variable).
*   **Icons:** Utilize `lucide-react` icons as per `shadcn/ui` standard practice, ensuring they align with the "Academia Futura" aesthetic (elegant, clear).
*   **Dark Mode:** Ensure all components and sections are fully compatible with the dark mode defined in "Academia Futura," maintaining readability and visual appeal.
## 5. Non-functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** The dashboard should load quickly and feel responsive.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
## 6. Future Considerations (Optional)
*   Gamification elements (badges, points).
*   Personalized learning path recommendations.
*   Direct messaging with instructors.
