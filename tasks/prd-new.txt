Product Requirements Document: Student Course Dashboard
1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a redesigned student course dashboard. The primary goal is to provide students with a clear, intuitive, and informative interface to track their learning progress, upcoming activities, and overall engagement with their course. The dashboard will leverage shadcn/ui components and adhere to the "Academia Futura - Sapphire Blue" design guidelines to ensure a clean, trustworthy, and intellectually stimulating user experience.
2. Design System and UI/UX Principles
* UI Framework: shadcn/ui
* Visual Style: "Academia Futura - Sapphire Blue" (as defined in CursorRules/Academic Futura - Sapphire Blue.md).
* Core Principles:
   * Clarity: Information should be presented in an easily scannable and understandable format.
   * Efficiency: Students should be able to find relevant information quickly.
   * Engagement: The interface should be visually appealing and encourage interaction.
   * Consistency: Adhere to the "Academia Futura" design language for all components and layouts.
3. Global Header & Navigation
3.1. Header Content & Style
* Purpose: To provide consistent branding and user account management access across the platform.
* Content:
   * Left: Zuvy Logo.
   * Right: User Account Icon (for access to profile, settings, logout options).
* Styling:
   * The header will have a glassmorphism effect applied to its background, providing a modern, translucent look that subtly reveals content scrolling underneath.
   * It should remain fixed or sticky at the top of the viewport as appropriate for user experience.
   * Height and padding should be consistent with the "Academia Futura - Sapphire Blue" design guidelines.
3.2. Navigation & Default View
* Burger Menu & Sidebar Removal:
   * The existing burger icon in the header and the associated pop-out sidebar (which previously included "Dashboard," "My Courses," and "Class Recordings") will be removed.
   * The "My Courses" link is not currently required as students are enrolled in a single course. Future multi-course navigation will be addressed separately if needed.
   * "Class Recordings" are now integrated into the "Course Module Details Page" (Section 5), making a separate global link redundant.
* Default View:
   * Upon successful login, the student will be directed to the Student Course Dashboard (Section 4) as their default landing page.
4. Student Dashboard (Primary View)
The main student dashboard serves as the central hub for students to get an overview of their academic activities and access their course. It will adopt a centered 12-column grid layout. There will be no persistent sidebar on this primary dashboard view.
4.1. Overall Dashboard Layout
The dashboard will be structured as follows:
1. Top: Course Information Banner (Spans full width of the 12-column grid)
2. Main Content Area (Below Banner): Divided into two columns:
   * Left Column (approx. 2/3 of the width):
      * "What's Next" Section
      * Course Modules Section
   * Right Column (approx. 1/3 of the width):
      * Attendance Section
4.2. Course Information Banner
* Purpose: To provide a prominent, at-a-glance overview of the current course and instructor.
* Layout: This banner will span the full width of the 12-column centered grid at the top of the dashboard.
* Content:
   * Left-aligned:
      * Course Name
      * Course Start and End Date
      * Total Progress Bar (a small visual indicator of overall course completion, does not need to span the entire width of the banner).
   * Right-aligned:
      * Instructor Avatar
      * Instructor Name
* Styling:
   * Prominently displayed at the top.
   * Utilize a Card or a similar container component if appropriate for visual grouping, or could be a distinct section without a card.
   * Adhere to "Academia Futura" typography and color schemes.
4.3. "What's Next" Section (Formerly Upcoming Section)
* Purpose: To highlight the most immediate time-sensitive items and upcoming deadlines for the enrolled course, helping students prioritize.
* Layout: This section will appear in the left column of the main content area, below the Course Information Banner.
* Content:
   * Instead of tabs, this section will display a single, consolidated list of the next five upcoming items (e.g., live classes, assignments, assessments/quizzes) ordered by their due date/time.
   * Each item in the list will display:
      * Icon: A distinct icon representing the item type (e.g., lucide-react icon for video for live class, edit for assignment, file-check for assessment).
      * Title/Name: The name of the class, assignment, or assessment.
      * Tag: A brief tag indicating the type and status (e.g., "Live Class Today", "Assignment Due Tomorrow", "Quiz Starts in 2 hours").
      * Brief Info: Key details such as class topic, specific deadline (date and time), or a short description.
      * Link/Action: A direct link to join the live class, view the assignment, or start the assessment.
   * Visual separators will be used between items in the list to maintain clarity.
* Styling:
   * The section itself can be a Card component.
   * List items should be clearly delineated.
   * Icons should be from lucide-react and match the "Academia Futura" theme.
4.4. Course Modules Section (Dashboard View)
* Purpose: To display the list of course modules in a linear progression, show individual module progress, provide access to topics within the current module, and allow navigation to a detailed page for each module. This approach aims to guide students sequentially through the course content.
* Layout: This section will appear in the left column of the main content area (approx. 2/3 of the width), below the "What's Next" section. Modules will be presented as a series of cards.
* Module Progression:
   * Modules are linear; the next module typically unlocks only after the current one is completed.
   * Locked modules should be visually indicated (e.g., greyed out, lock icon) and will not be interactive for starting or viewing details until unlocked.
* Module Card States & Content:
   * General Structure (for each module card):
      * Module Name: Clearly displayed.
      * Module Progress Bar: A small progress bar located directly below the module name, indicating the completion percentage of that specific module.
      * Expand/Collapse Icon: An icon on the right side of the card (e.g., chevron down for "expand more", chevron up for "expand less") to toggle the display of module topics.
   * Collapsed View (Default for non-current modules or previously completed modules):
      * Displays Module Name, Module Progress Bar, and "Expand More" icon.
   * Expanded View (Default for the currently active module; also when a user expands a collapsed module):
      * Displays Module Name, Module Progress Bar, and "Expand Less" icon.
      * List of Topics/Lessons:
         * A list of individual items (lessons, quizzes, projects) within that module.
         * Each topic will have a circle icon to its left, which changes to a checkmark icon upon completion of that topic.
         * Topic title.
      * Call to Action (CTA) Button: Positioned at the bottom of the expanded module card content. The button text and action will vary based on the module's status:
         * "Start Learning": If the module is unlocked but has not yet been started by the student. Clicking this could navigate to the Course Module Details Page.
         * "Resume Learning": If the student is currently in progress within this module. Clicking this could navigate to the Course Module Details Page, ideally to the last visited topic.
         * "Revise Concepts": If the module has been completed by the student. Clicking this could navigate to the Course Module Details Page for review.
* Interaction:
   * Clicking the "Expand More/Less" icon toggles the visibility of the topics list and CTA for that specific module.
   * The current module the student is actively working on will be expanded by default.
   * Clicking on a module's name, or its CTA button, will navigate the user to the "Course Module Details Page" (Section 5) for that specific module.
* Styling:
   * Each module should be represented as a distinct Card or similar container.
   * Visual distinction for locked, unlocked, in-progress, and completed modules.
   * Topic list should be clean and scannable. Icons (lucide-react) for topic status (circle, checkmark) and expand/collapse.
   * Progress bars should be clear and easy to understand.
   * CTAs should follow "Academia Futura" button styling guidelines.
   * Overall section spacing should follow space-y-6 or mb-6 between this section and others. Individual module cards might have less space between them (e.g., space-y-4).
4.5. Attendance Section
* Purpose: To visually track and incentivize consistent class attendance for the enrolled course.
* Layout: This section will occupy the right column of the main content area (approx. 1/3 of the width), alongside the "What's Next" and "Course Modules" sections.
* Content:
   * Streak Counter:
      * Display the current attendance streak (number of consecutively attended classes).
      * Accompanied by a visual indicator (e.g., fire icon from lucide-react).
      * Streak resets to 0 if a student misses a class.
   * Motivational Message:
      * A short message encouraging continued attendance (e.g., "Streak ongoing! Keep up the great momentum.", or a message if the streak is broken).
   * Last 3 Classes Status:
      * Display the attendance status for the last 3 chronological classes.
      * Each class should show:
         * An icon indicating attended (e.g., checkmark) or missed (e.g., exclamation mark/cross).
         * Class Topic/Name (abbreviated if necessary).
         * Date of the class.
   * Summary:
      * Text indicating the number of classes attended out of the last 3 (e.g., "2/3 classes attended").
